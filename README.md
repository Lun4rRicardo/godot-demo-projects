# Dodge the Creeps

This game follows "Your first 2D game" tutorial:

In this game, enemies will try to attack you and it is up to you to avoid these enemies for as long as possible, the longer you last, the more points you get. It is a 2D game made using godot engine. It uses GDscript as its coding language, however, there are versions of it that use C# and C++. THis game is a good beginner coding experience, as it is not overly complicated and provides somewhat of a challenge to code.
